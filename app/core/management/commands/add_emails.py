class Command(BaseCommand):
    """
      Django management command to add emails to the AssociatedEmail model for all users and solicitors.

      This command:
      1. Finds the first superuser in the database to assign as the `added_by` field in AssociatedEmail entries.
      2. Adds emails for users who are not staff (is_staff=False) to the AssociatedEmail model, if they arenâ€™t already associated.
      3. Adds solicitors' emails (if they exist) to the AssociatedEmail model, ensuring there are no duplicate entries.

      If no superuser is found, the command outputs an error and terminates.

      Methods:
      - handle: Main method that orchestrates the email addition process, including error handling.
      - add_users_to_associated_email: Adds emails of non-staff users to AssociatedEmail, marking the superuser as `added_by`.
      - add_solicitors_to_associated_email: Adds emails of solicitors to AssociatedEmail, with the superuser as `added_by`.

      Parameters:
      - None directly, but the command utilizes the User and Solicitor models, and the AssociatedEmail model for logging emails.

      Returns:
      None. This command logs information to the console and updates the database.

      Exceptions:
      - If an error occurs, it outputs an error message and raises the exception.

      Usage:
      Run this command from the command line with `python manage.py <command_name>`.
