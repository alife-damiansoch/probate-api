    <strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION - PROBATE ADVANCEMENT</strong><br><br>

    <strong>This is a probate advancement, not a traditional loan:</strong><br>
    • No monthly payments are required<br>
    • Repayment is due only when probate is granted (or at 36-month maximum term)<br>
    • You remain personally liable if probate proceeds are insufficient<br><br>

    <strong>Cost Structure:</strong><br>
    • Year 1: {{ initial_fee_percentage }}% charge applied immediately<br>
    • After Year 1: {{ daily_fee_percentage }}% per day on principal amount (simple interest)<br>
    • Exit Fee: {{ exit_fee_percentage }}% of outstanding balance at settlement<br><br>

    <strong>Key Risks:</strong><br>
    • If probate is delayed beyond the agreed term (minimum 12 months, maximum 36 months), full amount becomes
    immediately due<br>
    • If probate value is less than expected, you remain liable for any shortfall<br>
    • Interest continues to accrue until full settlement<br><br>

    Taking out this advance will affect your credit rating. Ensure you understand the probate process and potential
    timeline before proceeding.
